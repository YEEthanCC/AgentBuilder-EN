# Collaboration

AgentBuilder is a multi-user platform where workspaces are the basic units of team collaboration. Members of a workspace can create and edit applications and knowledge bases, and can also directly use public applications created by other team members in the Discover area.

## Login Methods

It is important to note that the login methods supported by AgentBuilder's cloud service and community edition differ, as shown in the table below.

|  |**Community version & AgentBuilder Premium**|**AgentBuilder Cloud**|**Enterprise version**|
|:-|:-----------------------------------|:-------------|:---------------------|
|Email Login|Supported|Not Supported|Supported|
|GitHub Login|Not Supported|Supported|-|
|Google Login|Not Supported|Supported|-|
|SSO Login|Not Supported|Not Supported|Supported| 

## Creating an Account

If you are using the cloud service, a workspace will be automatically created for you upon your first login, and you will become the administrator.

In the community version, you will be prompted to set an administrator email and password during installation. The community edition does not support the creation of multiple workspaces.
