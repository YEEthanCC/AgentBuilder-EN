# Conversation Application

Conversational applications engage in continuous dialogue with users in a question-and-answer format. These applications support the following features (ensure these functions are enabled during application orchestration):

- Variables filled out before the conversation.
- Creation, pinning, and deletion of conversations.
- Conversation opening statements.
- Next step question suggestions.
- Speech-to-text.
- References and attributions.

## Variables Filled Out Before the Conversation

If you have set variable filling requirements during application orchestration, you will need to fill out the prompted information before entering the conversation window:

Fill in the necessary details and click the "Start Conversation" button to begin chatting. Hover over the AI's response to copy the conversation content, and provide "like" or "dislike" feedback.

## Conversation Opener

If the "Conversation Opener" feature is enabled on the application orchestration page, the AI application will automatically initiate the first line of dialogue when a new conversation is created.

## Follow Up

If the "Follow-up" feature is enabled on the application orchestration page, the system will automatically generate 3 relevant question suggestions after the conversation:

Speech-to-Text
If the "Speech-to-Text" feature is enabled during application orchestration, you will see a speech input icon in the input box of the web application. Click the icon to convert speech to text:

Please ensure that your device environment is authorized to use the microphone.
