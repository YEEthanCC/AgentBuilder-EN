# Conditional Branch IF/ELSE

## Definition

Allows you to split the workflow into two branches based on if/else conditions.

A conditional branching node has three parts:

- IF Condition: Select a variable, set the condition, and specify the value that satisfies the condition.
- IF condition evaluates to True, execute the IF path.
- IF condition evaluates to False, execute the ELSE path.
- If the ELIF condition evaluates to True, execute the ELIF path;
- If the ELIF condition evaluates to False, continue to evaluate the next ELIF path or execute the final ELSE path.

### Condition Types

- Contains
- Not contains
- Starts with
- Ends with
- Is
- Is not
- Is empty
- Is not empty

## Scenario

Taking the above **Text Summary Workflow** as an example:

- IF Condition: Select the ```summarystyle``` variable from the start node, with the condition **Contains** ```technical```.
- IF condition evaluates to ```True```, follow the IF path by querying technology-related knowledge through the knowledge retrieval node, then respond via the LLM node (as shown in the upper half of the diagram);
- IF condition evaluates to ```False```, but an ```ELIF``` condition is added, where the input for the ```summarystyle``` variable **does not include** ```technology```, yet the ```ELIF``` condition includes ```science```, check if the condition in ```ELIF``` is ```True```, then execute the steps defined within that path;
- If the condition within ```ELIF``` is ```False```, meaning the input variable contains neither ```technology``` nor ```science```, continue to evaluate the next ```ELIF``` condition or execute the final ```ELSE``` path;
- IF condition evaluates to ```False```, i.e., the ```summarystyle``` variable input **does not contain** ```technical```, execute the ELSE path, responding via the LLM2 node (lower part of the diagram).

### Multiple Condition Judgments

For complex condition judgments, you can set multiple condition judgments and configure **AND** or **OR** between conditions to take the **intersection** or **union** of the conditions, respectively.
